Application Name: Vitality

Application Description: Vitality is your next  workout app tracker. It displays your list of logged workouts, both completed and incompleted. This way, you can keep track of your completed progress while still looking forward to upcoming workouts. Users have the ability to create distinct workouts that focus on either cardio or strength development. Users also have the ability to view their completed and incompleted workouts side by side, allowing for self-reflection of your progress, while maintaining the ability to modify/delete created workouts and change their status from incomplete to complete.
